# relational-markup-lang
A markup language that takes inspiration from HTML, but removed from HTML's tree structure using prepositions.

## Example
```rml
body { header, par1, footer }
header in body { Untitled Document }
par1 (main) after header { Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... }
footer after article { Copyright information }
```

## Example translated to HTML
```html
<body>
  <header>
    Untitled Document
  </header>
  <main>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
  </main>
  <footer>
    Copyright information
  </footer>
</body>
```

## Example explanation
Our example shows nested tags. Within body is a header, main, and footer (main has been given the name "par1" by the programmer). Later, the example defines what relations each of those tags has to each otherâ€”the header is in the body, par1 is after the header, and the footer is after par1. A stylesheet could define these prepositions, for example making `after` display the target content below the referred content with 50px padding, or it could display the target content 50 seconds afterward.

## Scope
Curly brackets define scope. To improve the legibility of the example, one might instead write
```rml
body { header, par1, footer } {
  header in body { Untitled Document }
  par1 (main) after header { Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... }
  footer after article { Copyright information }
}
```
which has no effect on the rendering of the document, but shows the tree structure of this particular example.
